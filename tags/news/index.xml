      <description>In a recent interview with the Ministry of Education, Dr Lan highlighted the innovative cross-disciplinary research at the Enable Center, founded by Professor Charles W. Tu. The centre gained attention last year when Dr Lan collaborated with Dr Ching-Wen Tan on an unprecedented project that merged the fields of entomology and mechanical engineering. Intrigued by the novel approach, Professor Tu asked Dr Lan to join him for this exclusive interview.</description>
