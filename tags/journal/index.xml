      <description>Heartfelt congratulations to Dr Lai&amp;rsquo;s team and Dr Lan on their seminal publication in &amp;lsquo;Ocean Engineering&amp;rsquo;. Their paper, &amp;lsquo;Strouhal number impact on propulsion efficiency in fully-active oscillating foils: Unpacking frequency, amplitude, and velocity relationships&amp;rsquo;, is not just a leap forward in marine technology but also holds immense potential for transforming oscillating foils technology across diverse realms, from the depths of the ocean to the intricacies of flapping flight.&#xA;For more information please refer to https://doi.</description>
