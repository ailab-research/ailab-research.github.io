      <description>&lt;p&gt;Under the guidance of Dr Lan, two student teams from the lab took part in the 2025 Bionic Design Competition (仿生設計競賽), an event showcasing nature-inspired innovation for sustainability. Among 78 entries, both teams received awards for their nature-inspired designs: one received a Merit Award for their bio-inspired stingray underwater vehicle, while the other was awarded Honourable Mention for a butterfly-inspired micro air vehicle. The competition, supported by Biomimicry Taiwan, promotes sustainable innovation rooted in natural principles, addressing global challenges from disaster resilience to environmental health.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
