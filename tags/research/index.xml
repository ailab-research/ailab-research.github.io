      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dr Lan was recognised with a Meritorious Research Award in this year’s Young Scholars Innovation Competition organised by the Taiwan Comprehensive University System (臺灣綜合大學系統). His research highlights a cross-domain biomimetic propulsion concept that leverages AI techniques to enhance energy efficiency in both aerial and aquatic environments. By drawing on natural movement strategies and translating them into engineered designs, this work demonstrates how bio-inspired thinking can open new possibilities for multifunctional propulsion, a direction that aligned strongly with the competition’s emphasis on innovative academic contributions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
