      <title>New Study on Odour Boundaries Published in Physica D</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/news/2025-07-18-journal/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/news/2025-07-18-journal/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dr Lan&amp;rsquo;s latest study, Flow-induced variations in odour boundary formation, explores how odours spread through moving air, an essential process in animal navigation and robotic sensing. Through flow simulations, the research introduces the concept of an &amp;lsquo;odour boundary&amp;rsquo; and analyses how it responds to changes in flow speed and diffusion conditions. The team found that while diffusion has limited effect, higher airflow speeds narrow and stabilise the odour boundary. These findings deepen our understanding of biological tracking behaviours and may aid the design of robots capable of locating odour sources in complex environments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/news/2025-03-05-kudos/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dr Lan and his research team have been recognised by the American Institute of Physics (AIP), with their latest study selected as a feature article on Kudos&amp;rsquo; Showcase platform. The research, titled &amp;lsquo;Balancing Thrust and Energy Efficiency: Optimised Asymmetric Flapping Inspired by Batoid Locomotion&amp;rsquo;, explores how the unique swimming motion of stingrays can inspire more efficient designs for underwater vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By using advanced computer simulations, the team discovered that shorter, quicker downstrokes—similar to how stingrays naturally move—enhance thrust while reducing energy consumption. These findings could lead to the development of underwater vehicles and robots that move more efficiently, with potential applications in marine exploration and environmental monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dr Lan, Dr Lai and their team have published a study in Physics of Fluids exploring how stingray-like asymmetric flapping enhances underwater propulsion. Using a NACA 0012 hydrofoil at a Reynolds number of 10,000 and NSGA-II optimisation, they identified six optimal motion patterns with brief downstrokes. Their findings reveal how harmonic tuning influences vortex dynamics, closely resembling natural swimming. This research provides key insights for designing efficient biomimetic aquatic robots, advancing underwater propulsion technology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
