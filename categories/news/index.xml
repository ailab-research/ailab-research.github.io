      <title>Breakthrough in Manta-like Swimming Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://ailab-research.github.io/news/2024-10-01-journal/</link>

      <description>A big congratulations to Dr Lai&amp;rsquo;s team and Dr Lan on the successful publication of their groundbreaking research in Physics of Fluids! Their study explores how manta-like swimming dynamics, specifically asymmetric motion parameters, can greatly enhance the efficiency of underwater unmanned vehicles. By investigating the effects of varying angles of attack and stroke duration, the research provides key insights into maximising thrust and propulsion efficiency. This work not only advances our understanding of aquatic biomechanics but also paves the way for innovative designs in biomimetic underwater technologies.</description>

      <guid>https://ailab-research.github.io/news/2023-07-25-edu-interview/</guid>
      <description>In a recent interview with the Ministry of Education, Dr Lan highlighted the innovative cross-disciplinary research at the Enable Center, founded by Professor Charles W. Tu. The centre gained attention last year when Dr Lan collaborated with Dr Ching-Wen Tan on an unprecedented project that merged the fields of entomology and mechanical engineering. Intrigued by the novel approach, Professor Tu asked Dr Lan to join him for this exclusive interview.</description>
