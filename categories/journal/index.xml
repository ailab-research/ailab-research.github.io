      <title>New Study on Odour Boundaries Published in Physica D</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dr Lan&amp;rsquo;s latest study, Flow-induced variations in odour boundary formation, explores how odours spread through moving air, an essential process in animal navigation and robotic sensing. Through flow simulations, the research introduces the concept of an &amp;lsquo;odour boundary&amp;rsquo; and analyses how it responds to changes in flow speed and diffusion conditions. The team found that while diffusion has limited effect, higher airflow speeds narrow and stabilise the odour boundary. These findings deepen our understanding of biological tracking behaviours and may aid the design of robots capable of locating odour sources in complex environments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dr Lan and Dr Lai&amp;rsquo;s latest study, &amp;lsquo;Accelerating Flapping Flight Analysis: Reducing CFD Dependency with a Hybrid Decision Tree Approach for Swift Velocity Predictions&amp;rsquo;, has been published in Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena. The research introduces a novel framework combining signal decomposition and decision tree algorithms, reducing computational time by up to 75% while maintaining high accuracy. Validated with damselfly data, this approach accelerates flapping flight analysis and supports the efficient design of micro air vehicles (MAVs), offering a scalable solution for future aerodynamic research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Published in Physics of Fluids: Biomimetic Propulsion Study</title>
      <link>https://ailab-research.github.io/news/2025-03-04-journal/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dr Lan, Dr Lai and their team have published a study in Physics of Fluids exploring how stingray-like asymmetric flapping enhances underwater propulsion. Using a NACA 0012 hydrofoil at a Reynolds number of 10,000 and NSGA-II optimisation, they identified six optimal motion patterns with brief downstrokes. Their findings reveal how harmonic tuning influences vortex dynamics, closely resembling natural swimming. This research provides key insights for designing efficient biomimetic aquatic robots, advancing underwater propulsion technology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A big congratulations to Dr Lai&amp;rsquo;s team and Dr Lan on the successful publication of their groundbreaking research in Physics of Fluids! Their study explores how manta-like swimming dynamics, specifically asymmetric motion parameters, can greatly enhance the efficiency of underwater unmanned vehicles. By investigating the effects of varying angles of attack and stroke duration, the research provides key insights into maximising thrust and propulsion efficiency. This work not only advances our understanding of aquatic biomechanics but also paves the way for innovative designs in biomimetic underwater technologies. Well done to the team on this impressive achievement!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
