      <description>Research Topics The lab undertakes research in a broad range of disciplines, aiming to integrate multiple subjects of studies with advanced machine learning methods. Currently, the lab is focusing on the following projects.&#xA;1. Odour Sensing Olfactory information is an important ability for living creatures. Animals can utilise it to localise foods, water and mates. However, the slow reaction speed of conventional gas sensors is a critical issue for an odour tracking robot.</description>
